## Institutions and Voter Decision-making

The dominant narrative in the literature on campaign effects and voting behavior is that elections are predictable. In the United States, forecasting models based on long-term factors like the economy and voters’ party affiliation often predict the winner months before the campaign has even started. In my dissertation, I argue that the view that campaigns don’t matter is a by-product of the focus on the United States, whose highly polarized two-party system represents a unique set of conditions that reduce the value of campaign information. My dissertation moves beyond assumptions of universality in voter cognition that result from an overreliance on the U.S. case to analyze how political institutions provide voters with incentives to use policy information. _Democracy in an Uncertain World: Campaign Information and Voter Decision-making_ compares the influence of policy information on vote choice in the United States, Canada and Germany using original Twitter data in combination with campaign-period surveys, as well as survey experiments.

Using a political communication model of issue voting and original Twitter data on the policy statements made by U.S. presidential candidates during the 2012 and 2016 electoral campaigns, I find that policy information does influence voting behavior in the United States, even when accounting for the effect of affective predispositions toward the candidates. My findings challenge the “echo chamber” thesis by showing that voters respond to policy statements that are congruent with their own position from both the congenial candidate and the candidate they are predisposed against, and in similar proportions. However, given the high baseline probability of voting for the congenial candidate, issue voting only plays a very limited role in explaining electoral outcomes. 

In contrast, [in another study](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.12891.69929) I find that the policy information and horse race polls disseminated during the campaign play an important role in a multiparty system like Germany by allowing voters to target a government coalition by voting for a minor partner that would bring policy outcomes closer to them. My results show that a substantial share of the Green party and FDP vote in the 2013 and 2017 federal elections was driven by these strategic considerations. 

Finally, the third study addresses a puzzle: if voters are risk-averse and dislike ambiguity, as it is assumed in the rational choice literature, why do electoral candidates routinely take ambiguous policy positions by making vague or contradictory statements? Using an experimental design that simulates an electoral campaign, I find that voters in the United States and Canada use the ambiguity of policy statements by major party candidates as a cue for non-centrist policy positions. My results show that policy ambiguity attracts voters who sit between the center and the extremes, yet it does so without repelling centrist and extremist voters. Hence it offers a solution to the puzzle and explains why policy ambiguity is an attractive strategy for electoral candidates.

In sum, my dissertation sheds light on the ways the structural environment of voters moderates the effect of campaign information on their decision.


## Campaign Effects

In the United States, forecasting models often predict electoral outcomes long before the electoral campaign starts. This begs the question: do campaigns matter?  Some argue that campaigns only have minimal effects: they merely activate “fundamentals”, understood as long-term structural forces, like the state of the economy and party identification. The counterpoint is that structural forces are only part of the story: the strategies of the candidates determine whether they are in fact activated, and can even induce new fundamentals that produce a durable shift in public opinion. 

In [The Predictable Campaign: Theory and Evidence](/files/apsa-campaigns-paper-johnston-lachance.pdf) (with Richard Johnston), we investigate how the institutional context conditions campaign effects.

In another project with Michael Weaver, we challenge the conventional assumption that Andrew Johnson’s “Swing Around the Circle” campaign was detrimental and argue that it caused a sustained reduction in the Republican vote share in congressional elections.



## Political Behaviour

My other main research area is political behaviour defined broadly, inside and outside the electoral context. 

In [What Role Does Affective Proximity Play in Canadian Elections?](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29053.49121/1) (with Edana Beauvais), we analyze whether the relationship between group-based affect and the vote in Canada reflects a polarized pluralism system across seven elections from 1993 to 2019. 

In [Policy Design, Cost Information and Support for Guaranteed Income](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/papers/?s=%22Policy+Design%2C+Cost+Information+and+Support+for+Guaranteed+Income%22) (with Richard Johnston and Alan Jacobs) we analyze how different information frames affect support for basic income in British Columbia.
