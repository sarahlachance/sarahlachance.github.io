## Institutions and Voter Decision-making

A normative view of democracy is that campaigns serve an essential function by delivering the information that voters need to choose the candidate that best represents their policy preferences. During the campaign, the candidates present their policy agenda, which will become their mandate if elected. In fact, however, both candidates and voters face incentives that prevent voters from being fully informed. Candidates strategically choose to emphasize a small set of issues and modulate the degree of policy information they disclose. On the voter side, limited resources and interest in politics constrain the amount of information they receive. In this context, how do voters decide which candidate best represents their policy preferences? Most of the answers to this question come from research on voters’ use of cognitive shortcuts in the United States, yet they are often framed as universal mechanisms.

My dissertation analyzes how institutions— the electoral system and the party system —provide incentives for voters to use policy information or, alternatively, to use cognitive shortcuts. To do so, I compare the influence of policy information on vote choice in the United States, Canada and Germany using data from original survey experiments and Twitter datasets as well as existing surveys. I argue that a bipartisan and polarized system like the United States provides incentives for using party labels as cognitive shortcuts, whereas multi-party systems incentivize the use of policy information because of their cross-cutting issue dimensions. Furthermore, by determining the extent of executive power-sharing, the electoral system influences the role of policy information from third parties in the vote decision-making process. 


## Campaign Effects

In the United States, forecasting models often predict electoral outcomes long before the electoral campaign starts. This begs the question: do campaigns matter?  Some argue that campaigns only have minimal effects: they merely activate “fundamentals”, understood as long-term structural forces, like the state of the economy and party identification. The counterpoint is that structural forces are only part of the story: the strategies of the candidates determine whether they are in fact activated, and can even induce new fundamentals that produce a durable shift in public opinion. 

In [The Predictable Campaign: Theory and Evidence](apsa-campaigns-paper-johnston-lachance.pdf) (with Richard Johnston), we investigate how the institutional context conditions campaign effects.

In another project with Micheal Weaver, we challenge the conventional assumption that Andrew Johnson’s “Swing Around the Circle” campaign was detrimental and argue that it caused a sustained reduction in the Republican vote share in congressional elections.



## Political Behaviour

My other main research area is political behaviour defined broadly, in and outside and electoral context. 

In [What Role Does Affective Proximity Play in Canadian Elections?](10.13140/RG.2.2.29053.49121) (with Edana Beauvais), we analyze how patterns in group-based affect in Canada reflect a polarized pluralism system and how they influence vote choice across seven elections from 1993 to 2019. 

In [Policy Design, Cost Information and Support for Guaranteed Income](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/) (with Richard Johnston and Alan Jacobs) we analyze how framing effects influence support for basic income in British Columbia.
