## Institutions and Voter Decision-making

At the heart of liberal democracy is the competent voter, who is deemed capable of making an informed decision. In fact, however, both electoral candidates and voters face incentives that prevent voters from being fully informed. Candidates strategically choose to emphasize a small set of issues and modulate the degree of policy information they disclose. On the voter side, limited resources and interest in politics constrain the amount of information they receive. In this context, how do voters decide which candidate or party best represents their policy preferences? 

My dissertation analyzes how political institutions provide incentives for voters to use policy information. To do so, I compare the influence of policy information on vote choice in the United States, Canada and Germany using original Twitter data in combination with campaign-period surveys, as well as survey experiments. I argue that in a bipartisan and polarized system like the United States, policy information only influences the voter's decision when it challenges their predispositions toward the candidates. In contrast, multi-party systems incentivize a broader use of policy information because parties are not aligned on a single ideological dimension. I also argue that voters use policy ambiguity as a shortcut to infer the extremity of candidates' policy positions. That is, vague position-taking on an issue signals that the candidate may implement policies that are extreme. Furthermore, by determining the extent of executive power-sharing, the regime type and electoral system influences the role of policy information from third parties in the vote decision-making process.


## Campaign Effects

In the United States, forecasting models often predict electoral outcomes long before the electoral campaign starts. This begs the question: do campaigns matter?  Some argue that campaigns only have minimal effects: they merely activate “fundamentals”, understood as long-term structural forces, like the state of the economy and party identification. The counterpoint is that structural forces are only part of the story: the strategies of the candidates determine whether they are in fact activated, and can even induce new fundamentals that produce a durable shift in public opinion. 

In [The Predictable Campaign: Theory and Evidence](/files/apsa-campaigns-paper-johnston-lachance.pdf) (with Richard Johnston), we investigate how the institutional context conditions campaign effects.

In another project with Michael Weaver, we challenge the conventional assumption that Andrew Johnson’s “Swing Around the Circle” campaign was detrimental and argue that it caused a sustained reduction in the Republican vote share in congressional elections.



## Political Behaviour

My other main research area is political behaviour defined broadly, in and outside and electoral context. 

In [What Role Does Affective Proximity Play in Canadian Elections?](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29053.49121/1) (with Edana Beauvais), we analyze how patterns in group-based affect in Canada reflect a polarized pluralism system and how they influence vote choice across seven elections from 1993 to 2019. 

In [Policy Design, Cost Information and Support for Guaranteed Income](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/papers/?s=%22Policy+Design%2C+Cost+Information+and+Support+for+Guaranteed+Income%22) (with Richard Johnston and Alan Jacobs) we analyze how framing effects influence support for basic income in British Columbia.
