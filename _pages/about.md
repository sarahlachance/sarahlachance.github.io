I am a Political Science Ph.D. Candidate at the University of British Columbia.
  My research investigates elections and political behavior in a comparative perspective, using existing surveys as well as original survey experiments. 
  My dissertation analyzes how institutions shape voter information-processing and decision-making in Canada, the United States and Germany.
