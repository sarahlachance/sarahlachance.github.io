I am a Political Science Ph.D. Candidate at the University of British Columbia (major: Comparative Politics; minor: Canadian Politics).

My research investigates elections and political behavior using quantitative methods with observational and experimental data. 
My dissertation analyzes how institutions shape voter information-processing and decision-making in Canada, the United States and Germany.
