I am a Postdoctoral Fellow affiliated with POLPOP-II, a comparative international study of regional and national elected representatives. I am also affiliated with the Policy, Elections & Representation Lab (PEARL) at the University of Toronto.

My research investigates questions related to political psychology and political behaviour in Canada and other democracies. I am particularly interested in how voters and politicians make decisions, and how it impacts democratic representation. To answer these questions, I use mostly quantitative methods with observational and experimental data.
