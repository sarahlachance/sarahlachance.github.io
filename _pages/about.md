I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Policy, Elections & Representation Lab (PEARL) in the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy at the University of Toronto.

I use a comparative approach to investigate questions related to political psychology and political behaviour. To answer these questions, I use mainly quantitative methods with observational and experimental data. My main research focus is the influence of institutions on the decision-making process of elites and voters. My broader research interests include Canadian politics, elections, campaign effects and representation.
