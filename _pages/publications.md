**Group-based Affect and the Canadian Party System** (with Edana Beauvais)

Forthcoming in _Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique_, 2024

In terms of party systems, Canada's is an outlier. In this article, we develop Johnston's account of Canada's polarized pluralism in three ways. First, we link the literature on party systems to social identity theory. Second, we make an empirical contribution by directly testing Johnston's claim that inter-group affect plays a central role in shaping the dynamics of the party system. Using Canadian Election Study (CES) data from seven elections, we offer strong empirical support for the theory of polarized pluralism. Congruent with existing research, we find that the most important feature summarizing group-based affect in Canadian politics corresponds with the ideological Left-Right divide; but we also find that feelings toward groups on a second, uncorrelated axis (feelings toward Quebec and minority groups) shape vote choice. Yet, our results show that fault lines in the polarized pluralist structure of the Canadian party system are emerging.


[Policy Signals and Strategic Voting for Minor Parties: Evidence from Germany](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2022.102577)

Published in _Electoral Studies_, 2023

How does executive power-sharing in multiparty democracies influence voter decision-making? The current scholarship has identified two strategies that voters use to target coalitions and that involve voting for a minor party: coalition insurance voting and compensatory voting. Yet these strategies are not differentiated conceptually, and empirically, are observationally equivalent. By foregrounding the role of policy signals in strategic voting for minor parties, the present study disentangles these strategies at the theoretical and empirical levels. It also proposes a new, hybrid, strategy. To do so, it uses data on the 2013 and 2017 German federal elections from campaign-period surveys, polls and an original dataset of the candidates’ tweets about policy issues. The results show evidence of policy-driven voters using a hybrid strategy in 2013 and a compensatory strategy in 2017. There is no evidence of coalition insurance voting in these elections.


[The Predictable Campaign: Theory and Evidence](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1eCKv_5yMsmGYm) (with Richard Johnston)

Published in _Electoral Studies_, 2022

Are campaigns epiphenomena? The dominant answer in the US literature seems to be Yes. Outcomes are driven by ‘fundamental’ considerations in place before the campaign begins, such that dynamics within the campaign reflect the elimination of ‘accidental’ considerations. Multi-country comparisons, where they exist, tend to be fragmentary. Where they are not fragmentary, they are taken from so high an altitude that critical interpretive details are lost. Also fragmentary, surprisingly, is documentation of the US case itself. This paper identifies two overlapping but distinct claims: about frontrunners and about incumbents.  We also identify an insufficiently recognized fact, that the very idea of a ‘fundamental’ is contested, and that this broadens the scope for potential within-campaign dynamics. We employ rolling cross-section survey data from the US, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and Canada. 


[Telephone versus Online Survey Modes for Election Studies: Comparing Canadian Public Opinion and Vote Choice in the 2015 Federal Election](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0008423917000610) (with Charles Breton, Fred Cutler and Alex Mierke-Zatwarnicki)

Published in _Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique_, 2017

Election studies must optimize on sample size, cost and data quality. The 2015
Canadian Election Study was the first CES to employ a full mixed-mode design, aiming to take
advantage of the opportunities of each mode while preserving enough commonality to compare
them. This paper examines the phone interviews conducted by ISR-York and the online questionnaires
from panellists purchased from a sample provider. We compare data quality and representativeness.
We conduct a comprehensive comparison of the distributions of responses across modes
and a comparative analysis of inferences about voting. We find that the cost/power advantages of
the online mode will likely make it the mode of choice for subsequent election studies.

[Policy Design, Cost Information and Support for Guaranteed Income](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/papers/?s=%22Policy+Design%2C+Cost+Information+and+Support+for+Guaranteed+Income%22) (with Richard Johnston and Alan Jacobs)

Published on [BC Basic Income Panel](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/), 2020

This report presents the results of two studies on support for guaranteed income using survey experiments conducted on British Columbia voters. In the first, we test the effect of different policy designs that vary on characteristics like benefit type and eligibility. In the second, we select the two policy designs with the highest support in Study 1 and we test the effect of providing information about their cost on support. We also look at the interaction between demographic variables, like income and education, and our experimental variables.
