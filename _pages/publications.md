[Telephone versus Online Survey Modes for Election Studies: Comparing Canadian Public Opinion and Vote Choice in the 2015 Federal Election](http://sarahlachance.github.io/files/breton_telephone.pdf) (with Charles Breton, Fred Cutler and Alex Mierke-Zatwarnicki)

Published in _Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique, 2017_

Election studies must optimize on sample size, cost and data quality. The 2015
Canadian Election Study was the first CES to employ a full mixed-mode design, aiming to take
advantage of the opportunities of each mode while preserving enough commonality to compare
them. This paper examines the phone interviews conducted by ISR-York and the online questionnaires
from panellists purchased from a sample provider. We compare data quality and representativeness.
We conduct a comprehensive comparison of the distributions of responses across modes
and a comparative analysis of inferences about voting. We find that the cost/power advantages of
the online mode will likely make it the mode of choice for subsequent election studies.

[Policy Design, Cost Information and Support for Guaranteed Income](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Policy_Design_Cost_Information_and_Support_for_Guaranteed_Income.pdf)(with Richard Johnston and Alan Jacobs)

Published on [BC Basic Income Panel](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/), 2020

This report presents the results of two studies on support for guaranteed income using survey experiments conducted on British Columbia voters. In the first, we test the effect of different policy designs that vary on characteristics like benefit type and eligibility. In the second, we select the two policy designs with the highest support in Study 1 and we test the effect of providing information about their cost on support. We also look at the interaction between demographic variables, like income and education, and our experimental variables.
