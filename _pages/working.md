[Campaign Effects on Strategic Voting for Minor
Parties in Germany](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.27042.96961)

This study uses a novel campaign effects model of strategic voting for minor parties in
multiparty democracies that compares the relative importance of coalition insurance voting,
compensatory voting, and a hybrid strategy. To do so, it uses data on the 2013 and 2017
German federal elections from campaign-period surveys, polls and an original dataset of the
candidates’ tweets about policy issues. The results show evidence of policy-driven voters using
a hybrid strategy in 2013 and a compensatory strategy in 2017. There is no evidence
of coalition insurance voting in these elections. These findings reaffirm the view that the
campaign plays a crucial role in the decision-making process of voters, in this case by allowing
them to target coalitions based on policy. Yet, the implications of these findings for
electoral outcomes are limited: depending on the case, 0.5% to 1.7% voters are estimated to
be strategic.

[What Role Does Affective Proximity Play in Canadian Elections?](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29053.49121) (with Edana Beauvais)

Voters' feelings toward social and political groups can impact their political behaviour. 
How does group-based affect— voters' relatively warmer or colder feelings toward different groups —impact their vote choice? 
The goal of our present work is twofold. Our frst task is descriptive:
What does the "affective space" look like in Canada? To answer this question, we use data
from the Canadian Election Study on feelings toward ethnic groups, sexual minorities, political
parties, and national groups (e.g., Canadians, Quebeckers, and Americans). We use unsupervised machine 
learning techniques to reduce the dimensionality of affective space in Canada.
Our second task is inferential: How does group-based affect impact vote choice? To answer this
question, we regress vote choice on two, uncorrelated dimensions of group-based affect— ideological and ethnocultural —in seven
different elections from 1993 to 2019 in Quebec and Canada
outside Quebec. Our results suggest that voters' group-based affect contributes to polarized
pluralism in the party system (Johnston, 2017), but that fault lines are also emerging.

[The Predictable Campaign: Theory and Evidence](/files/apsa-campaigns-paper-johnston-lachance.pdf) (with Richard Johnston)

Most of what we know about electoral campaigns originates in the United States. And
what we know emphasizes the predictability of outcomes and the role of campaigns in
producing that predictability. This forecasting success reflects the operation of what are
styled as “fundamentals,” factors that campaigns activate in roughly similar ways election
after election. Although some analysts suggest that the US pattern travels abroad, the
evidence is fragmentary and never rests on quite the same basis as the US original. To the
extent that US findings reflect the operation of universals, notably in voter cognition, they
should be replicated elsewhere. But critical to US analyses— sometimes considered
explicitly but more often merely assumed —are institutional conditions: timing, money, the
electoral system, the effective number of parties, parties’ internal organization, and the
sheer scale of the US economy. Our tests of the arguments employ survey data from the US, Germany, and Canada.
The comparative record is mixed and reveals contingencies that underlie the US case.
