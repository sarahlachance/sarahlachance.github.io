excerpt: 'This report presents the results of two studies on support for guaranteed income using survey
experiments conducted on British Columbia voters. In the first, we test the effect of different
policy designs that vary on characteristics like benefit type and eligibility. In the second,
we select the two policy designs with the highest support in Study 1 and we test the effect of
providing information about their cost on support. We also look at the interaction between
demographic variables, like income and education, and our experimental variables.
