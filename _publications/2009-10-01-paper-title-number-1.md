title: "Telephone versus Online Survey Modes for Election
Studies: Comparing Canadian Public Opinion and
Vote Choice in the 2015 Federal Election"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Election studies must optimize on sample size, cost and data quality. The 2015
Canadian Election Study was the first CES to employ a full mixed-mode design, aiming to take
advantage of the opportunities of each mode while preserving enough commonality to compare
them. This paper examines the phone interviews conducted by ISR-York and the online questionnaires
from panellists purchased from a sample provider. We compare data quality and representativeness.
We conduct a comprehensive comparison of the distributions of responses across modes
and a comparative analysis of inferences about voting. We find that the cost/power advantages of
the online mode will likely make it the mode of choice for subsequent election studies.'
